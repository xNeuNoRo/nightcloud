**Nightcloud** is a **local-first, self-hosted private cloud platform** focused on giving users full control over their data and infrastructure.

The project explores a **modular and extensible approach** to building a private cloud that can run on local or on-premise environments, with an emphasis on **privacy, security, and data ownership**.

Nightcloud is designed to run on **your own infrastructure**, avoiding reliance on third-party public cloud providers while allowing flexibility to integrate internal services and workflows.

This public repository represents an **early-stage and experimental phase** of the project. The long-term goal is to evolve Nightcloud into a **robust and reliable platform suitable for more advanced and professional use cases**, including organizational environments.
